  <h2>1. Overview</h2>
  <p>
    This Refund Policy ("Policy") describes the terms and conditions for refunds and cancellations
    for echoe ("Service"), operated by ECHO HQ CO., LTD. ("Company," "we," "us," or "our").
    By subscribing to our Service, you agree to this Policy.
  </p>
  <p>
    Please read this Policy carefully before making a purchase. We encourage you to use any
    free trial periods available to evaluate the Service before committing to a paid subscription.
  </p>

  <h2>2. No Refund Policy</h2>
  <p>
    <strong>All fees paid to us are non-refundable.</strong> This is a strict no-refund policy
    that applies to:
  </p>
  <ul>
    <li>Monthly subscription fees</li>
    <li>Annual subscription fees</li>
    <li>Partial subscription periods (monthly or annual)</li>
    <li>Unused features or services within your plan</li>
    <li>Plan upgrades or downgrades</li>
    <li>Add-on purchases</li>
    <li>API usage fees</li>
    <li>Any other charges related to the Service</li>
  </ul>
  <p>
    We implement this policy because our Service involves significant infrastructure costs,
    development resources, and third-party service fees that are incurred regardless of
    individual usage patterns.
  </p>

    <li>You can cancel at any time before the trial ends without any charge</li>
    <li>If you do not cancel before the trial ends, your payment method will be charged</li>
  </ul>
  <p>
    <strong>Important:</strong> Once the trial period ends and you are charged, our standard
    no-refund policy applies. We strongly encourage you to evaluate the Service thoroughly
    during the trial period.
  </p>
