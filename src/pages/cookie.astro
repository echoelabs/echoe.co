  <h2>1. Introduction</h2>
  <p>
    This Cookie Policy explains how ECHO HQ CO., LTD. ("Company," "we," "us," or "our") uses
    cookies and similar tracking technologies on echoe ("Service"). By using our Service,
    you consent to the use of cookies as described in this policy.
  </p>
  <p>
    This policy is designed to comply with the EU ePrivacy Directive (2002/58/EC), GDPR,
    UK PECR regulations, and other applicable cookie and privacy laws worldwide.
  </p>
  <p>
    This policy should be read alongside our <a href="/privacy">Privacy Policy</a>, which
    explains how we handle your personal information.
  </p>

  <h2>2. What Are Cookies?</h2>
  <p>
    Cookies are small text files that are stored on your device (computer, tablet, or mobile)
    when you visit a website. They are widely used to make websites work more efficiently,
    remember your preferences, and provide information to website owners.
  </p>
  <p>We also use similar technologies including:</p>
  <ul>
    <li><strong>Local Storage:</strong> Similar to cookies but can store more data and persists until explicitly cleared</li>
    <li><strong>Session Storage:</strong> Stores data for the duration of your browser session only</li>
    <li><strong>Pixels/Web Beacons:</strong> Tiny images embedded in web pages that help us understand user behavior</li>
    <li><strong>Device Fingerprinting:</strong> Identifying devices based on browser and system characteristics (we do not use this)</li>
  </ul>
  <p>
    Throughout this policy, we refer to all these technologies collectively as "cookies."
  </p>

  <h2>3. Legal Basis for Using Cookies</h2>
  <p>
    Under the EU ePrivacy Directive (Cookie Law) and GDPR, we must inform you about cookies
    and, in most cases, obtain your consent before placing them on your device.
  </p>

  <h2>4. Our Consent-Based Approach</h2>
  <p>
    We believe in respecting your privacy choices. Our tracking approach is entirely consent-based
    and compliant with global cookie regulations:
  </p>

  <h3>4.1 Before You Consent (Default)</h3>
  <ul>
    <li>We use <strong>anonymous, cookieless tracking</strong> only</li>
    <li>No cookies are stored on your device (except strictly necessary ones)</li>
    <li>Analytics data is stored in memory only and cleared when you close your browser</li>
    <li>We cannot identify you across sessions or devices</li>
    <li>Basic, anonymous usage statistics are collected</li>
  </ul>

  <h3>4.2 After You Consent</h3>
  <ul>
    <li>Full analytics cookies are enabled</li>
    <li>Session tracking across page visits</li>
    <li>Cross-session identification for better user experience insights</li>
    <li>Optional session recordings (for debugging and UX improvement)</li>
    <li>Preference cookies to remember your settings</li>
  </ul>

  <h2>5. Types of Cookies We Use</h2>

  <h3>5.1 Strictly Necessary Cookies</h3>
  <p>
    These cookies are essential for the website to function properly. They enable core
    functionality such as security, consent management, and authentication. You cannot
    opt out of these cookies as the Service cannot function without them.
  </p>

    <thead>
      <tr>

        <th>Purpose</th>
        <th>Duration</th>

    </tbody>
  </table>

  <h3>5.2 Analytics/Performance Cookies</h3>
  <p>
    These cookies help us understand how visitors interact with our website by collecting
    and reporting information. We use PostHog for analytics. <strong>These cookies are only
    set after you consent.</strong>
  </p>
  <table>
    <thead>
      <tr>
        <th>Cookie Name</th>
        <th>Purpose</th>
        <th>Duration</th>
        <th>Provider</th>
      </tr>
    </thead>
    <tbody>
      <tr>
        <td>ph_*</td>
        <td>PostHog analytics - unique visitor identification</td>
        <td>1 year</td>
        <td>PostHog (via a.echoe.co)</td>
      </tr>
      <tr>
        <td>ph_sessionId</td>
        <td>PostHog session tracking</td>
        <td>Session</td>
        <td>PostHog (via a.echoe.co)</td>
      </tr>
    </tbody>
  </table>
  <p>
    <strong>Without consent:</strong> PostHog operates in "memory-only" mode, which doesn't
    store any cookies or persistent identifiers. All data is cleared when you close your browser.
  </p>

  <h3>5.3 Functionality/Preference Cookies</h3>
  <p>
    These cookies enable the website to remember choices you make (such as your language,
    region, or display preferences) and provide enhanced, personalized features.
  </p>
  <table>
    <thead>
      <tr>
        <th>Cookie Name</th>
        <th>Purpose</th>
        <th>Duration</th>
        <th>Provider</th>
      </tr>
    </thead>
    <tbody>
      <tr>
        <td>echoe-preferences</td>
        <td>User interface preferences</td>
        <td>1 year</td>
        <td>echoe.co</td>
      </tr>
      <tr>
        <td>echoe-theme</td>
        <td>Theme preference (light/dark mode)</td>
        <td>1 year</td>
        <td>echoe.co</td>
      </tr>
    </tbody>
  </table>

  <h3>5.4 Marketing/Advertising Cookies</h3>
  <p>
    Marketing cookies are used to track visitors across websites to display relevant
    advertisements. <strong>Currently, we do not use marketing cookies.</strong>
  </p>
  <p>
    This section is included for transparency about our future practices. If we implement
    marketing cookies, we will:
  </p>
  <ul>
    <li>Update this Cookie Policy</li>
    <li>Request your explicit consent</li>
    <li>Provide opt-out mechanisms</li>
    <li>List all marketing cookies and their purposes</li>
  </ul>

  <h2>6. Third-Party Cookies</h2>
  <p>
    We use third-party services that may set cookies on your device. Here are the
    third-party services we use:
  </p>

  <h3>6.1 PostHog (Analytics)</h3>
  <table>
    <tbody>
      <tr>
        <td><strong>Purpose</strong></td>
        <td>Product analytics and user behavior insights</td>
      </tr>
      <tr>
        <td><strong>Data Collected</strong></td>
        <td>Page views, clicks, user interactions, session recordings (with consent)</td>
      </tr>
      <tr>
        <td><strong>Data Location</strong></td>
        <td>United States</td>
      </tr>
      <tr>
        <td><strong>Privacy Policy</strong></td>
        <td><a href="https://posthog.com/privacy" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">posthog.com/privacy</a></td>
      </tr>
    </tbody>
  </table>
  <p>
    <strong>Note:</strong> We route PostHog traffic through our own subdomain (a.echoe.co) as
    a reverse proxy. This improves reliability and ensures analytics work correctly even if
    you use an ad blocker. The data is still processed by PostHog according to their privacy policy.
  </p>

  <h3>6.2 Cloudflare (Security & Performance)</h3>
  <table>
    <tbody>
      <tr>

      </tr>
      <tr>
        <td><strong>Data Location</strong></td>
        <td>Global (edge network)</td>
      </tr>

  </table>

  <h3>6.3 Stripe (Payments)</h3>
  <table>

      </tr>
      <tr>
        <td><strong>Data Collected</strong></td>
        <td>Payment information, transaction data, device information</td>
      </tr>
      <tr>
        <td><strong>Data Location</strong></td>
        <td>United States / EU</td>

  <h2>8. Do Not Track Signals</h2>
  <p>
    Some browsers include a "Do Not Track" (DNT) feature that sends a signal to websites
    requesting that your browsing not be tracked. Currently, there is no universal standard
    for how websites should respond to DNT signals.
  </p>
  <p>
    We do not currently respond to DNT signals automatically. However, we respect your privacy
    choices made through our cookie consent banner, which provides clear control over tracking.
  </p>

  <h2>9. Global Privacy Control (GPC)</h2>
  <p>
    Global Privacy Control is a browser-based signal that indicates your privacy preferences.
    If your browser sends a GPC signal, we will:
  </p>
  <ul>
    <li>Treat it as a valid opt-out request</li>
    <li>Not set non-essential cookies</li>
    <li>Run analytics in anonymous mode only</li>
    <li>Apply appropriate privacy protections</li>
  </ul>
  <p>
